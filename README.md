## Design

The website has a clean layout with the Champions League colors and the logo as a header for the website. When you come in on the website you see the logo, the rules for the quiz and the start button. Underneath the game area, on the bottom of the page, you can see my social media links.

### Colours

The colors used for the website were mainly chosen from the colors that the Champions League use. The colors and the logo are very important. When the user jumps on to the website, they will get a feeling of the Champions League because of the right colors and the logo.

![colour-pallete](docs/readme-images/color.png)

### Typography

Google fonts were used to get the right fonts and all the fonts were imported from there. The font for the heading in the welcome and rules area is a font called Kalnia and for the rest of the content the Lato font is used. In case If the user's browser doesn't read the fonts that are chosen, I put in a second font called Sans-serif for both of them.

## Features
